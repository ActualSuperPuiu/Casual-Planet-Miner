# Casual Planet Miner

Planet miner is a game I made using raylib and lua.
It is a basic game about mining planets. You can change between them, upgrade your mining powerand other.

# Compiling and using
If you want to compile your own version, you have to download two things: [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) and [this binding](https://github.com/TSnake41/raylib-lua).
After you download and install both raylib and the lua binding, unzip the binding and then use raylua_e to compile, or raylua_s to run directly (interpreted).
