# Casual Planet Miner

Casual Planet miner is a game I made using raylib and lua.
It is a basic game about mining planets. You can change between them, upgrade your mining powerand other.


# Compiling and using

For custom compiling, you need [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) and [lua binding](https://github.com/TSnake41/raylib-lua).
Older code is undocumented and may break any time, be careful if you're editing it!

# Glitched versions and Other
Glitched versions are versions that were released without much testing. They usually crash, the game might be insecure and other.
