# Casual Planet Miner

Casual Planet miner is a game I made using raylib and lua.
It is a basic game about mining planets. You can change between them, upgrade your mining powerand other.


# Compiling and using
To run the game, you need to run the raylib installer that comes with the game or you can download it [here](https://www.raylib.com) (for building your own version, you have to download this as well[this binding](https://github.com/TSnake41/raylib-lua).)
